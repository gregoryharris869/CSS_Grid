            <h2>Understanding CSS Grid Layout</h2>
            <p>
              CSS Grid is a powerful, two-dimensional layout system for the web,
              allowing you to design complex responsive layouts with ease.
              Unlike Flexbox, which works in one dimension (rows or columns),
              Grid excels at arranging content in both rows and columns
              simultaneously. This makes it perfect for laying out entire pages
              or large sections, giving you a structured and predictable way to
              organize your content.

            <h2>Key Grid Terminology</h2>
            <p>
              To use CSS Grid effectively, understand these core concepts: The
              grid container is the element where you apply display: grid; and
              its direct children are grid items. Grid lines divide the grid
              into rows and columns, creating grid tracks (the space between
              lines) and grid cells (the intersection of a row and column). A
              grid area is a rectangular space defined by four grid lines. You
              define column and row sizes with grid-template-columns and
              grid-template-rows, and set spacing with gap. Properties like
              justify-items and align-items control item alignment within cells,
              while justify-content and align-content align the grid tracks
              themselves.

            <h2>Practical Grid Uses</h2>
            <p>
              CSS Grid offers many advantages for diverse layouts. It's
              excellent for whole page layouts, structuring headers, sidebars,
              and main content, and also for individual component layouts like
              image galleries or product listings. Grid simplifies responsive
              design with fractional units and functions like minmax(), adapting
              layouts gracefully to various screen sizes. Placing items
              precisely is easier with properties like grid-column-start or
              named grid areas. Grid can even reorder content independently of
              source order and often leads to cleaner HTML and CSS by providing
              a direct way to define element relationships in 2D space.
