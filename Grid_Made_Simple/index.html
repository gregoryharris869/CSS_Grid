          <h2>Understanding CSS Grid Layout</h2>
          <p>
            CSS Grid is a powerful, two-dimensional layout system for the web,
            allowing you to design complex responsive layouts with ease. Unlike
            Flexbox, which works in one dimension (rows or columns), Grid excels
            at arranging content in both rows and columns simultaneously. This
            makes it perfect for laying out entire pages or large sections,
            giving you a structured and predictable way to organize your
            content.

          <h2>Key Grid Terminology</h2>
          <p>
            To use CSS Grid effectively, understand these core concepts: The
            grid container is the element where you apply display: grid; and its
            direct children are grid items. Grid lines divide the grid into rows
            and columns, creating grid tracks (the space between lines) and grid
            cells (the intersection of a row and column). A grid area is a
            rectangular space defined by four grid lines. You define column and
            row sizes with grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows, and set
            spacing with gap. Properties like justify-items and align-items
            control item alignment within cells, while justify-content and
            align-content align the grid tracks themselves.

          <h2>Practical Grid Uses</h2>
          <p>
            CSS Grid offers many advantages for diverse layouts. It's excellent
            for whole page layouts, structuring headers, sidebars, and main
            content, and also for individual component layouts like image
            galleries or product listings. Grid simplifies responsive design
            with fractional units and functions like minmax(), adapting layouts
            gracefully to various screen sizes. Placing items precisely is
            easier with properties like grid-column-start or named grid areas.
            Grid can even reorder content independently of source order and
            often leads to cleaner HTML and CSS by providing a direct way to
            define element relationships in 2D space.
